# nsqd - the daemon that receives, queues, and delivers messages
#
# It can be run standalone but is normally configured in a cluster with
# nsqlookupd instance(s) (in which case it will announce topics and channels
# for discovery).
#
# It listens on two TCP ports, one for clients and another for the HTTP API.
# It can optionally listen on a third port for HTTPS.
